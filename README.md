# Linear System Solvers
Linear System Solvers library. Written in C++17. It contains a few wrappers around CUDA cuSolver library functions plus some other well known solvers.
It also contains some PDE solvers.

## Usage
Just started.
To see how to use this library see header files ending with _t.
I will soon describe in detail how to use this library.
